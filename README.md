# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to detect fake news using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages a dataset of news articles labeled as fake or real and applies various preprocessing and classification steps to build an effective prediction model.

## 📌 Features

- Data preprocessing using NLP techniques (TF-IDF, tokenization, etc.)
- Binary classification of news articles (Fake vs Real)
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
